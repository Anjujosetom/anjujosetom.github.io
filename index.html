  <h3>1. Machine Learning Compliance Model for government home exemption scheme</h3>
 <p>
  Designed and implemented the first <b>machine learning–driven compliance model in the department</b> for a major Home Exemption scheme, 
  leveraging <b>multi-agency historical data</b> and advanced feature engineering. The solution achieved an impressive 
  <b>98% accuracy</b> in predicting and validating exemption claims, significantly improving the efficiency of compliance 
  checks. This initiative was <b>highly recognised by leadership</b> as a breakthrough in applying AI for compliance 
  analytics inside the organization, demonstrating how <b>data science can drive fairness, transparency, and automation</b> in regulatory processes.  
  Due to the <b>confidential nature of government compliance data</b>, further details on methodology and datasets are not 
  disclosed, but the project highlights the <b>transformative role of AI</b> in public sector governance.
</p>
  <p>
    My role included building the <b>proof-of-concept</b>, collaborating with stakeholders to gather requirements, 
    and presenting results to leadership.  
    I also developed <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP) bulk solution pipelines</b> to process data from over <b>a bulk number of confidential SharePoint case folders</b>,

  </p>

  <h3>5. Trust Deeds to Structured Data – Databricks Project from publically available Trust deed dataset</h3>
  <p>
    Led the development of a <b>Databricks-based data pipeline</b> to convert unstructured <b>legal trust deeds</b> into structured, queryable data.  
    This project demonstrated how <b>Delta Lake, Spark SQL, and NLP pipelines</b> can extract key clauses, parties, and compliance indicators from thousands of legal documents.  
  </p>
  <p>
    The solution enabled <b>automated compliance checks</b>, improved audit readiness, and allowed treasury/legal teams to run analytics on previously inaccessible data.  
    It highlights my expertise in combining <b>cloud-scale data engineering</b> with <b>AI-driven document intelligence</b> to solve real-world regulatory problems.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Designed a large-scale <b>Spark NLP pipeline</b> to extract structured insights from over <b>29,000 PDF and Word files</b> contained in <b>4000+ confidential SharePoint case folders</b>.  
    These documents represented <b>notices of registration for charitable institutions</b>, containing critical compliance and governance information.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Using <b>Databricks</b> and <b>Spark NLP</b>, I developed an automated workflow to extract and standardize key fields such as registration details, dates, and entity names.  
    This project accelerated <b>compliance auditing</b>, enabled <b>faster data-driven policy decisions</b>, and showcased my ability to operationalize <b> AI at scale on sensitive government data</b>.  
  </p>

  <h3>7. Visual Search Engine using Semantic Cosine Similarity (GenAI Project)</h3>
  <p>
    This work is part of <b> Generative AI </b>, showcasing innovation in <b>embeddings, semantic similarity, and user-preference modeling</b>.  
    I developed a <b>semantic similarity embedding and sampling algorithm</b> for large-scale image datasets that dynamically integrates <b>user preferences</b> with representation learning.  
    By leveraging <b>cosine similarity</b> and transfer learning from nine pre-trained models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet, MobileNet, Xception), 
    the system enables <b>personalized visual search</b> and <b>efficient semantic sampling</b>.  
    Experiments on the COCO dataset highlight how transfer learning and user-centric weighting can drive accurate semantic search and efficient resource utilization.

<h3>8. AI-Powered Identification of Residential Buildings on Farmland (Geospatial ML Project)</h3>
<p>
  This project combined <b>Queensland Building Footprints</b> with <b>satellite imagery</b> to identify residential buildings 
  located within farmland by analysing the surrounding greenery. Using vegetation indices such as <b>NDVI</b>, the workflow 
  distinguished farmland areas with high vegetation cover from non-farmland residential zones, enabling classification of 
  buildings based on their land context. The approach provided an efficient, scalable method to validate land use patterns, 
  improve compliance monitoring, and support <b>evidence-based decision making</b> for planning and revenue assurance.  
  The project was <b>implemented with a sample dataset</b>, demonstrating its potential to detect misclassified properties and 
  strengthen policy enforcement across Queensland.
</p>
<h3>9. Land Valuation Predictions (ML Regression Project)</h3>
<p>
  This project developed a <b>machine learning–driven model</b> to forecast land valuations across Queensland by integrating 
  <b>historical sales data, cadastral boundaries, property attributes, and economic indicators</b>. Using advanced regression 
  and ensemble techniques, the model captured spatial, temporal, and market trends to predict future land values with 
  higher accuracy than traditional valuation methods. The solution enables government and policy teams to anticipate 
  revenue shifts, guide fair taxation, and support <b>urban planning</b>, ultimately improving transparency, efficiency, 
  and compliance in the land valuation process.  
  The project was <b>implemented with a sample dataset</b>, demonstrating the capability of <b>regression models</b> to 
  estimate property values effectively.
</p>
<h3>10. Data-Driven Credit Risk Assessment Using Machine Learning</h3>
<p>
  This project built a <b>machine learning model</b> to predict bank loan eligibility by analysing applicant details such as 
  <b>income, credit history, employment type, loan amount, and collateral information</b>. Using classification algorithms 
  including <b>Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting</b>, the system identified key risk factors and 
  generated accurate eligibility predictions. The model streamlined the loan approval process, reduced manual effort, and 
  minimised default risks, enabling banks to make faster, <b>data-driven lending decisions</b> while improving customer 
  experience and financial compliance.  
  The project was <b>implemented with a sample dataset</b>, showcasing how <b>classification models</b> can effectively 
  support credit risk assessment in real-world scenarios.
</p>
<h3>11. Intelligent Fiscal Forecasting with ML Ensembles</h3>
<p>
  This project applied <b>machine learning ensemble methods</b> such as <b>XGBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting</b> 
  to forecast <b>transfer duty revenue</b> by analysing historical transaction data, property attributes, and economic trends. 
  The model captured complex patterns and provided more accurate revenue predictions than traditional methods, enabling 
  <b>fiscal planning, revenue assurance, and policy analysis</b>. By enhancing foresight into revenue trends, the solution 
  supports government agencies in <b>strategic decision making</b> and budget alignment.  
  The project was <b>implemented with a sample dataset</b>, demonstrating the effectiveness of ML ensembles for 
  <b>financial forecasting</b>.
</p>
<h3>12. Data-Driven Compliance Monitoring with Fraud Detection AI</h3>
<p>
  This project developed an <b>AI-based fraud detection system</b> to identify <b>suspicious transfer duty transactions</b> 
  by analysing attributes such as declared value, property type, transaction location, and payment patterns. Leveraging 
  <b>machine learning classification models</b>, the system flagged high-risk cases with strong predictive accuracy, enabling 
  <b>early detection of fraudulent activity</b> and supporting compliance teams in risk prioritisation. The approach improved 
  <b>operational efficiency</b>, reduced financial leakage, and strengthened the <b>governance framework</b> for property 
  tax administration.  
  The project was <b>implemented with a sample dataset</b>, demonstrating the practical application of <b>AI in fraud risk 
  management</b>.
